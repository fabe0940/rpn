REVERSE POLISH NOTATION CALCULATOR
==================================


Overview
--------

This project is assignment #4 for CS121.

The purpose of this assignment is to gain a working understanding
of the "stack" data structure by creating a calculator which uses
[reverse polish notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).


Building
--------

To build, simply run the make utility:

```
make
```


Running
-------

Assuming the `rpn` file generated by `make` is executable, then
simply type:

```
./rpn
```

After that, the calculator will launch and prompt you to begin
your session.


Reverse Polish Notation
-----------------------

In reverse Polish notation the operators follow their operands;
for instance, to add 3 and 4, one would write `3 4 +` rather than
`3 + 4`. If there are multiple operations, the operator is given
immediately after its second operand; so the expression written
`3 - 4 + 5` in conventional notation would be written `3 4 - 5 +`
in RPN: first subtract 4 from 3, then add 5 to that. An advantage
of RPN is that it obviates the need for parentheses that are
required by infix. While `3 - 4 * 5` can also be written
`3 - (4 * 5)`, that means something quite different from
`(3 - 4) * 5`. In postfix, the former could be written `3 4 5 * -`,
which unambiguously means `3 (4 5 *) -` which reduces to `3 20 -`;
the latter could be written `3 4 - 5 *` (or 5 3 4 - *, if you wish
to keep similar formatting), which unambiguously means `(3 4 -) 5 *`.
